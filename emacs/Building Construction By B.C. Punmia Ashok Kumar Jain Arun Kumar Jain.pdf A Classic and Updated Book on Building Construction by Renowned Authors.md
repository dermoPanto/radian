One way is to learn from the experts who have been in the industry for years and have faced and solved many construction issues. By following their advice and best practices, you can avoid common mistakes and pitfalls and improve your efficiency and productivity. Here are some of the top building construction tips and tricks that we have gathered from the experts over the years:

1. **Get organized.** One of the most important aspects of any construction project is organization. You need to have a clear and detailed plan of what you want to achieve, how you will achieve it, who will be involved, what resources you will need, and what timeline you will follow. You also need to have a system for managing your documents, contracts, drawings, specifications, permits, invoices, change orders, communications, and other information. A good organization system will help you keep track of everything and avoid confusion, errors, delays, and disputes. One tool that can help you with this is Newforma software[^1^], which is designed specifically for construction project management.
2. **Communicate effectively.** Another key factor for a successful construction project is communication. You need to communicate clearly and frequently with all the parties involved in your project, such as your client, your team members, your subcontractors, your suppliers, your consultants, and your inspectors. You need to establish a communication protocol that defines who will communicate what, when, how, and to whom. You also need to use the appropriate communication tools and channels for different purposes and audiences. For example, you can use email for formal and official communications, phone calls for urgent and important issues, text messages for quick updates and reminders, video conferencing for meetings and presentations, and cloud-based platforms for sharing files and documents.
3. **Choose quality materials.** The materials you use for your construction project will have a significant impact on the quality, durability, performance, appearance, and cost of your final product. Therefore, you need to choose materials that are suitable for your project's specifications, requirements, standards,
and expectations. You also need to consider factors such as availability,
delivery time,
storage conditions,
installation methods,
maintenance needs,
and environmental impact. You should research different material options,
compare their pros and cons,
and consult with experts if needed. You should also inspect the materials before using them
and reject any defective or damaged ones.
