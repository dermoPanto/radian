## Method 1: Using an Object's Initialization Box
 
This method is the easiest and most straightforward way to add Virtual Arsenal to your mission. You just need to place an object that you want to use as a container for the Virtual Arsenal, such as a box, a vehicle, or a building. Then, you need to add this code to the object's initialization box:
 `[\"AmmoboxInit\", [this,true]] call BIS_fnc_arsenal;` 
This code will turn any container into a Virtual Arsenal that you can access by walking up to it and selecting "Open Virtual Arsenal" from the action menu. You can use any object as a container, but make sure it has enough space for your gear and weapons. You can also change the name of the action from "Open Virtual Arsenal" to something else by replacing it in the code.
 
## Method 2: Using a Supply Drop Module
 
This method is more advanced and allows you to add Virtual Arsenal to a supply drop that you can call in using a support requester module. You will need to place a supply drop module, a support requester module, an aircraft that will drop the supply box, and sync them together. Then, you will need to add this code to the supply drop module's crate init box:
 ` _this addAction [\"Open Virtual Arsenal\",  [\"Open\",true] spawn BIS_fnc_arsenal];` 
This code will add an action to the supply box that will open the Virtual Arsenal when you interact with it. You can also change the name of the action as in method 1. To call in the supply drop, you will need to sync the players who you want to be able to request it to the support requester module. Then, you can use the support menu (0-8) to request a supply drop at your location.
 
## Method 3: Using a Script
 
This method is the most flexible and allows you to add Virtual Arsenal to any object or trigger using a script. You will need to create a file called VA.sqf in your mission folder and paste this code inside it:
 `_object = _this select 0;
_object addAction ["Open Virtual Arsenal",  ["Open",true] spawn BIS_fnc_arsenal];` 
This code will create a function that will add an action to any object that you pass as an argument. You can also change the name of the action as in method 1. To use this function, you will need to call it from another script or from an object's or trigger's initialization box. For example, if you want to add Virtual Arsenal to a trigger that activates when you enter it, you can add this code to the trigger's on activation field:
 `nul = [thisTrigger] execVM "VA.sqf";` 
This code will execute the VA.sqf script and pass the trigger as an argument. You can use any object or trigger as an argument, but make sure it is accessible and visible.
