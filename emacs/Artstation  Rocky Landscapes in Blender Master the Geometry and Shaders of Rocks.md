Blender is a powerful and free 3D software that can be used to create realistic and stylized environments. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Blender's sculpting tools and modifiers to create rocky landscapes inspired by Artstation's concept art.
 
We will start by creating a base mesh for the terrain using a plane and a subdivision surface modifier. Then we will use various sculpting brushes and masks to add details and shapes to the terrain. We will also use a multiresolution modifier to increase the resolution of the mesh and add finer details.

Next, we will create a material for the terrain using Blender's node editor. We will use a mix of procedural textures and image textures to create realistic colors and bumps for the rocks. We will also use a displacement node to add more depth and variation to the surface.

Finally, we will set up the lighting and camera for the scene. We will use an HDRI image to create realistic lighting and reflections for the environment. We will also add some fog and volumetric effects to create a sense of atmosphere and depth. We will adjust the camera settings and composition to create a dynamic and appealing shot.
 
By following this tutorial, you will learn how to create stunning rocky landscapes in Blender that can be used for your own projects or portfolio. You will also learn some useful tips and tricks for sculpting, texturing, lighting, and rendering in Blender.
  
## Step 1: Creating the Base Mesh
 
The first step is to create a base mesh for the terrain. We will use a plane and a subdivision surface modifier to create a smooth and subdivided surface.
 
To do this, follow these steps:
 
- Add a plane object to the scene by pressing **Shift + A** and choosing **Mesh > Plane**.
- Scale the plane to a large size by pressing **S** and dragging the mouse.
- In the modifier panel, add a subdivision surface modifier by clicking on the wrench icon and choosing **Add Modifier > Subdivision Surface**.
- Increase the levels of subdivision to 4 or 5 for both the viewport and the render.
- Apply the modifier by clicking on the apply button.

You should now have a smooth and subdivided plane that will serve as the base for our terrain.
  
## Step 2: Sculpting the Terrain
 
The next step is to sculpt the terrain using Blender's sculpting tools and masks. We will use various brushes and settings to create different shapes and details for the rocks.
 
To do this, follow these steps:

- Switch to sculpt mode by pressing **Ctrl + Tab** and choosing **Sculpt Mode**.
- In the tool settings panel, choose a brush that suits your needs. For example, you can use the **Clay Strips** brush to add volume and mass to the terrain, or the **Crease** brush to create sharp edges and cracks.
- Adjust the strength, radius, and other settings of the brush as needed. You can also use the **F** and **Shift + F** keys to change the radius and strength of the brush on the fly.
- Sculpt the terrain by clicking and dragging on the surface. You can also use the **Ctrl** key to invert the effect of the brush.
- To create more variation and realism, you can use masks to isolate certain areas of the terrain. To do this, press **M** to activate the mask brush, and paint over the areas you want to mask. You can also use the **Ctrl + I** shortcut to invert the mask.
- To clear the mask, press **Alt + M**.

You should now have a sculpted terrain with different shapes and details for the rocks.
  
## Step 3: Adding a Multiresolution Modifier
 
The final step for sculpting is to add a multiresolution modifier to increase the resolution of the mesh and add finer details. The multiresolution modifier allows us to subdivide the mesh without changing its shape, and also gives us access to different levels of detail.
 
To do this, follow these steps:

- In the modifier panel, add a multiresolution modifier by clicking on the wrench icon and choosing **Add Modifier > Multiresolution**.
- Increase the levels of subdivision to 2 or 3 for both the viewport and the render.
- In sculpt mode, switch to a higher level of detail by clicking on the up arrow in the multiresolution panel.
- Use a finer brush, such as the **Draw** or **Inflate** brush, to add small details and bumps to the rocks.
- You can also switch back to a lower level of detail by clicking on the down arrow in the multiresolution panel.

You should now have a high-resolution terrain with fine details for the rocks.
