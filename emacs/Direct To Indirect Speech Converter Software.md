Direct speech is when you quote someone's exact words, using quotation marks and punctuation. For example:
 
**Download Zip ---> [https://t.co/pDxOcUlKAw](https://t.co/pDxOcUlKAw)**


 

> "I love this app," he said.

Indirect speech is when you report what someone said, without using their exact words. You usually use a reporting verb and a linker to introduce the reported speech. For example:

> He said that he loved the app.

Direct and indirect speech have different rules for verb tenses, pronouns, time and place expressions, and punctuation. Sometimes, you may need to convert direct speech to indirect speech, or vice versa, depending on the context and purpose of your writing. For example, you may want to avoid using too many direct quotations in an academic essay, or you may want to add some direct quotations in a narrative story.
