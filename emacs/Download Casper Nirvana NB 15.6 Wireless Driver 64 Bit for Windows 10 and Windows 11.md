## Step 1: Identify Your Wireless Adapter Model
 
The first step is to identify the model of your wireless adapter. This will help you find the right driver for your device. There are two ways to do this:
 
- Check the label on the bottom of your laptop. You should see a sticker with a barcode and some numbers. Look for the model number that starts with "CN-". For example, CN-WF511.
- Use Device Manager to find the model of your wireless adapter. To do this, follow these steps:
    1. Press Windows key + X and select Device Manager from the menu.
    2. Expand the Network adapters category and look for your wireless adapter. It should have a name that includes "Wireless", "WiFi", or "WLAN". For example, Realtek RTL8723BE Wireless LAN 802.11n PCI-E NIC.
    3. Right-click on your wireless adapter and select Properties.
    4. Click on the Details tab and select Hardware Ids from the drop-down menu.
    5. Look for the value that starts with "VEN\_" and "DEV\_". These are the vendor ID and device ID of your wireless adapter. For example, VEN\_10EC&DEV\_B723.

Once you have identified your wireless adapter model, you can proceed to the next step.
