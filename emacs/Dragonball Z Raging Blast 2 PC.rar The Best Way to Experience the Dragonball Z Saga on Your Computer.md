# Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2 - A Review of the PC Version
 
Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2 is a fighting game based on the popular anime and manga series Dragon Ball. It was originally released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in 2010, but recently a fan-made PC version has been created and uploaded online. The PC version is a modified version of the Xbox 360 game, which requires an emulator and a controller to run. The PC version also includes some additional features, such as higher resolution, custom soundtracks, and online multiplayer.

The game features over 90 playable characters from the Dragon Ball universe, each with their own unique moves and transformations. The game also has several modes, such as Battle Mode, where players can fight against the computer or another player; Galaxy Mode, where players can complete various challenges and unlock new characters and items; and Raging Soul Mode, where players can unleash their full power and perform devastating attacks. The game also has a Story Mode, which covers some of the major sagas from the anime, such as the Saiyan Saga, the Frieza Saga, and the Cell Saga.
 
The game has received mixed reviews from critics and fans. Some praised the game for its large roster of characters, its fast-paced combat, and its faithful recreation of the anime's style and atmosphere. Others criticized the game for its repetitive gameplay, its lack of innovation, and its poor online functionality. The PC version has also been met with some technical issues, such as bugs, crashes, and compatibility problems.
 
Overall, Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2 is a game that appeals to fans of the Dragon Ball series who want to relive some of their favorite moments from the anime. However, it is not a game that offers much depth or variety for casual or new players. The PC version is a commendable effort by fans to bring the game to a wider audience, but it is not without its flaws and limitations.

The game's graphics and sound are faithful to the anime's style and atmosphere. The characters are well-designed and animated, and the environments are colorful and destructible. The game also features the original Japanese voice actors for the characters, as well as an English dub option. The game's soundtrack consists of rock and metal songs that fit the mood of the battles.
 
The game's gameplay is fast-paced and chaotic, as players can fly, dash, teleport, and perform various combos and special moves. The game also features a Raging Soul system, which allows players to enter a state of enhanced power and speed, but at the cost of being unable to use their signature attacks. The game also has a Team Attack system, which allows players to perform coordinated attacks with their allies. The game's controls are simple and intuitive, but they also require timing and strategy to master.

The game also has a Replay Channel, where players can watch and save their own or other players' matches. However, the game's online mode suffers from some issues, such as lag, disconnections, and hackers.
