Histopathologic Techniques is a book that provides a concise and comprehensive overview of the principles and methods involved in histotechnology, the study of microscopic anatomy of tissues. The book was written by Jocelyn H. Bruce-Gregorios, a neuropathologist and professor at the University of Miami-Miller School of Medicine, and Marc-Eli Medina Faldas, a histotechnologist and laboratory manager at the same institution. The book covers topics such as tissue processing, histologic staining, cytology, immunohistochemistry, molecular biology techniques, and laboratory risk management. The book also includes a brief course in immunology, explaining the antigen-antibody reactions and the steps required for immunostaining.

The book is intended for students, teachers, and practitioners of histotechnology, pathology, and related fields. It aims to provide a clear and updated guide for the preparation and interpretation of tissue specimens for diagnosis and research. The book is divided into 18 chapters, each with learning objectives, key points, review questions, and references. The book also contains numerous illustrations, tables, and diagrams to enhance the understanding of the concepts and procedures. The book is available in both print and ebook formats[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].
 
Histopathologic Techniques is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about the science and art of histotechnology. It offers a comprehensive and practical approach to the subject, with emphasis on quality control and safety precautions. The book is written by experts in the field, who share their knowledge and experience with clarity and accuracy. The book is suitable for both beginners and advanced learners of histotechnology, as well as for anyone who wants to refresh their skills or update their knowledge.

Some of the topics covered in the book are:
 
- Tissue fixation: The process of preserving the structure and function of tissue specimens by using chemical or physical agents.
- Tissue processing: The process of preparing tissue specimens for microscopic examination by dehydrating, clearing, infiltrating, and embedding them in a suitable medium.
- Histologic staining: The process of applying dyes or other substances to tissue sections to enhance their contrast and visibility under the microscope.
- Cytology: The study of individual cells and their morphology, function, and pathology.
- Immunohistochemistry: The technique of using antibodies to detect specific antigens in tissue sections.
- Molecular biology techniques: The techniques of using DNA or RNA probes to identify genetic or infectious agents in tissue sections.
- Laboratory risk management: The practice of identifying, assessing, and controlling the hazards and risks associated with working in a histology laboratory.

The book also provides tips and tricks for troubleshooting common problems and errors in histotechnology, as well as appendices with useful information such as staining protocols, conversion tables, and glossary of terms. The book is written in a clear and concise language, with a logical and consistent format. The book is well-organized and easy to follow, with a balance between theory and practice. The book is also up-to-date with the latest developments and innovations in histotechnology, such as microwave processing, digital pathology, and quality assurance standards.
