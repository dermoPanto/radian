The film begins with Major General Amarjeet Singh (Amitabh Bachchan), a dedicated officer for the Indian army, who is proud of his son Lieutenant Commander Vikramjeet Singh (Bobby Deol) who follows in his footsteps and joins the army. However, tragedy strikes when Vikramjeet is killed in action during the 1971 Indo-Pak war. Many years later, Vikramjeet's son Captain Kunal Singh (Bobby Deol) joins the army but has no intentions of remaining there. He plans to leave, settle abroad and earn lots of money. Amarjeet is disappointed with Kunal as he hopes his grandson would do something to honour his deceased father.
 
Kunal comes across a desert party and sees Shweta Bhansali (Divya Khosla Kumar), a beautiful girl who he falls in love with at first sight. However, she ignores him and avoids him as she is already married. Shweta had fallen in love and married Major Rajeev Singh (Akshay Kumar), a brave and loyal officer who was deployed for action on his wedding day. Rajeev had to leave his newly wed bride to fight against terrorists in Kashmir. He was captured by the enemy and presumed dead by everyone except Shweta, who still waits for him.
 
Kunal decides to pursue Shweta and tries to win her over. He also changes his mind about leaving the army and decides to stay back and serve his country. He gets posted to Kashmir where he meets Colonel Ashfaque Khan (Danny Denzongpa), who is actually a double agent working for a terrorist leader named Maqsood Bhat (Govind Namdeo). Ashfaque plans to assassinate Amarjeet, who is visiting Kashmir for a peace mission. Kunal also discovers that Rajeev is still alive and held captive by Maqsood. He decides to rescue him and expose Ashfaque's treachery.
